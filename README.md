# Knowledge Graph-Based Visualization Platform for Cancer Molecular Marker and Drug Repositioning

The application value of knowledge graph is reflected in data analysis, intelligent search, intelligent recommendation, human-computer interaction, and decision support. 
It is found that cancer is one of the major diseases that cause human death. 
The construction of cancer knowledge graph is important to promote the progress of cancer diagnosis and treatment technology and assist doctors in treating cancer patients. 
In view of the current research status at home and abroad, this paper proposes and solves the following two engineering problems: 

By using the graph database Neo4j to organize cancer classification data, 
cancer molecular marker data and drug repositioning data in an unstructured way to build cancer knowledge graph, 
this paper achieves the purpose of reducing the difficulty of understanding abstract cancer data and improving the scalability of data and website maintainability. 
This paper solves the engineering problem of complicated and difficult data expansion and maintenance in the later stage of the website caused by the use of structured data in the existing website. 

This paper uses the Flask network framework and the open source graph theory library Cytoscape.js to build a cancer knowledge graph visualization and analysis platform, 
and constructs a user-friendly cancer knowledge graph platform. 
It solves the engineering problems of poor interactivity and user unfriendly use of existing websites, 
which bring about difficulties for users to understand data information and to obtain personalized needed data information.
